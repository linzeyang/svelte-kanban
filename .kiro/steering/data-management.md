# Data Management and Storage Guidelines

## Data Storage Strategy
- **Primary Storage**: Browser localStorage for client-side persistence
- **Session Storage**: Temporary data during user sessions
- **Future Considerations**: Database integration for multi-user scenarios

## Data Validation Principles
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Implement proper error handling for data operations
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Handle storage quota exceeded errors gracefully

## Error Handling Standards
- Provide user feedback for storage failures
- Implement fallback mechanisms for critical data
- Validate data integrity on load
- Log errors for debugging purposes

## Performance Considerations
- Debounce frequent save operations
- Use batch updates for multiple changes
- Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Clean up unused data references

## Data Migration Strategy
- Implement version management for data structure changes
- Provide data recovery options
- Backup critical data before modifications
- Clear corrupted data with user consent
