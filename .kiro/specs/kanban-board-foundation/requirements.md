# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational interface for the AI-Native Kanban application, including a navigation sidebar and the primary Kanban board workspace. The interface will feature a left-hand navigation panel for extensibility and a main content area displaying the four-column Kanban board. The design will use a modern, futuristic aesthetic with dark themes, neon accents, and smooth animations that provide an engaging user experience while maintaining high performance standards and supporting future feature integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a navigation sidebar with extensible structure, so that I can access different features and the application can grow with additional functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a left-hand navigation sidebar with consistent width
2. WHEN viewing the sidebar THEN it SHALL contain a "Kanban" tab that is clickable and visually indicates the current active view
3. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same futuristic design theme with neon accents and dark background
4. WHEN future features are added THEN the sidebar SHALL accommodate additional navigation items without layout disruption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see a four-column Kanban board layout in the main content area, so that I can visualize the workflow stages of my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Kanban tab is active THEN the system SHALL display four distinct columns labeled "To Do", "In Progress", "Testing", and "Done" in the main content area
2. WHEN viewing the board THEN each column SHALL have a visually distinct header with appropriate status-specific styling
3. WHEN the board is displayed THEN the columns SHALL be evenly distributed across the available main content width (excluding sidebar)
4. IF the main content width is insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling to maintain column visibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the entire interface to have a modern, futuristic appearance, so that the interface feels engaging and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface renders THEN the system SHALL apply a dark theme with neon gradient accents using OKLCH color space to both sidebar and main content
2. WHEN displaying the sidebar THEN it SHALL have neon borders and gradient backgrounds consistent with the overall theme
3. WHEN displaying columns THEN each column SHALL have neon borders with status-specific colors (blue for To Do, purple for In Progress, green for Testing, cyan for Done)
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL use the Inter font family for text and maintain proper typography hierarchy across all components
5. WHEN navigation items are displayed THEN they SHALL have hover effects and active states with appropriate neon highlighting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive across different screen sizes, so that I can use it effectively on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop screens THEN the system SHALL display the sidebar and all four columns with adequate spacing
2. WHEN viewing on tablet screens THEN the system SHALL maintain sidebar and column visibility with appropriate sizing adjustments
3. WHEN viewing on mobile screens THEN the system SHALL collapse or minimize the sidebar and provide horizontal scrolling for columns
4. WHEN resizing the browser window THEN the system SHALL smoothly adapt the layout using container queries while maintaining sidebar-main content proportions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth visual transitions and animations, so that the interface feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL animate the sidebar and columns into view with staggered entrance effects
2. WHEN hovering over navigation items or interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide subtle hover effects within 16ms response time
3. WHEN switching between navigation tabs THEN transitions SHALL complete within 300ms using fluid easing curves
4. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance without frame drops

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be accessible, so that it can be used by people with different abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management across sidebar navigation and columns
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the sidebar navigation and each column SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and roles
3. WHEN viewing the interface THEN text SHALL maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios against backgrounds in both sidebar and main content
4. WHEN interacting with navigation or board elements THEN all interactive elements SHALL have adequate touch target sizes (44px minimum)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the interface structure to support future feature expansion, so that additional functionality can be easily integrated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface is implemented THEN the system SHALL use a component-based architecture with clear separation between navigation and content areas
2. WHEN the sidebar is created THEN it SHALL support dynamic addition of new navigation items through a configurable structure
3. WHEN columns are created THEN each column SHALL accept a tasks array prop for future task rendering
4. WHEN the interface structure is defined THEN it SHALL include proper TypeScript interfaces for navigation items, board state, and extensibility
5. WHEN implementing the layout THEN the system SHALL use modern CSS features (container queries, OKLCH colors, 3D transforms) and CSS Grid for the main layout structure
